# Project Title

# Analysing Employee’s Performance for HR Analytics
## Description
This project will train you how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

## About Dataset
You will be using a real-world dataset of the Employee's records to complete this project. This project intends to evaluate the provided dataset, solve business problems on this dataset and mine information insights. 



# Data source

I have used the data available at HiCounselor website [HR analytics data challenge, 2023](https://hicounselor.com). The dataset fulfils the requirements for the project and is in the CSV format.

## Module 1: Pre-processing the dataset

## Module 2: Run SQL queries 
# Step by Step Process of Live Project Execution
1. Data cleaning with **Python**:

- removing duplicates and
- handling null values,
- deletion or transformation of irrelevant values,
- data type transformation,
- data validations.

2. **SQL** Queries:

- aggregating the data,
- grouping the data,
- ordering the data,
- using case
- use having
- sub queries etc


# Module 1: Data Preprocessing using python
## Steps To Perform Data Preprocessing
- **Step 1**: Removing duplicate rows.
- **Step 2**: Removing rows for which numeric columns are having irrelevant data type values
- **Step 3**: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation all values for a column, Check for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.Feel free to add more validation checks which you might feel necessary for the dataset’s integrity
- **Step 4**: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding.

We get cleaned dataset in csv.Then perform following steps.
- **Step 5**: Convert the pre-processed dataset into an SQL file. 
- **Step 6**: Manually generate a table by utilizing the database information provided in the "Database Info" tab.

# Module 2:
In this module, you will be working on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducting Data Analysis using SQL. You will generate queries for given problem statements. 


### Task 1: Find the average age of employees in each department and gender group. 
- ( Round average age up to two decimal places if needed).

### Task 2:List the top 3 departments with the highest average training scores. 
- ( Round average scores up to two decimal places if needed)


### Task 3:Find the percentage of employees who have won awards in each region. 
- (Round percentages up to two decimal places if needed)


### Task 4:Show the number of employees who have met more than 80% of KPIs for each recruitment channel and education level.


### Task 5:Find the average length of service for employees in each department, considering only employees with previous year ratings greater than or equal to 4.
- (Round percentages up to two decimal places if needed)


### Task 6:List the top 5 regions with the highest average previous year ratings.
- ( Round average ratings up to two decimal places if needed)


### Task 7:List the departments with more than 100 employees having a length of service greater than 5 years.


### Task 8:Show the average length of service for employees who have attended more than 3 training, grouped by department and gender. 
- ( Round average length up to two decimal places if needed)


### Task 9:Find the percentage of female employees who have won awards, per department. Also show the number of female employees who won awards and total female employees. 
- ( Round percentage up to two decimal places if needed)

### Task 10:Calculate the percentage of employees per department who have a length of service between 5 and 10 years. 
- ( Round percentage up to two decimal places if needed)


### Task 11:Find the top 3 regions with the highest number of employees who have met more than 80% of their KPIs and received at least one award, grouped by department and region.


### Task 12:Calculate the average length of service for employees per education level and gender, considering only those employees who have completed more than 2 trainings and have an average training score greater than 75.
-  ( Round average length up to two decimal places if needed)

### Task 13:For each department and recruitment channel, find the total number of employees who have met more than 80% of their KPIs, have a previous_year_rating of 5, and have a length of service greater than 10 years.

### Task 14:Calculate the percentage of employees in each department who have received awards, have a previous_year_rating of 4 or 5, and an average training score above 70, grouped by department and gender .
- ( Round percentage up to two decimal places if needed).

### Task 15:List the top 5 recruitment channels with the highest average length of service for employees who have met more than 80% of their KPIs, have a previous_year_rating of 5, and an age between 25 and 45 years, grouped by department and recruitment channel. 
- ( Round average length up to two decimal places if needed).
